        <p className="w-3/4 my-2 text-black text-xl">
          God saw you getting tired, and a cure was not to be, so He put his arms around you, and
          whispered "Come to Me."
        </p>
        <p className="w-3/4 my-2 text-black text-xl">
          With tearful eyes we watched you suffer, and saw you fall away. Although we couldn't bear
          to lose you, we could not ask you to stay. A golden heart stooped beating, hardworking
          hands lay to rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us, that He only takes the best.
